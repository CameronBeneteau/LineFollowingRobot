Computer Engineering Project
- Design and Build a Robot that follows a black line

Constraints
- Wheels of robot must stay on opposite sides of thr black line at all times
- Robot must brake/stop when it detects an object within 20cm front its front (demoed with green plastic in Robot_Vid)

Materials:
- Arduino Uno
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- Servos
- QTR Sensors
- Chassis

**Grade: 100%**




Automated Line Following Robot 2019
Technologies: C++, Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic Sensor, QTR Sensor, Servos
• Created an autonomous real-time embedded robotic vehicle using an Arduino microcontroller and 
various sensors designed to follow a specified black line on the ground
• Designed and implemented C++ algorithms that interfaced with hardware sensors to control the robot
